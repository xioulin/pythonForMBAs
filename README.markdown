This is a Jupyter Notebook project utilizing a used car dataset from Kaggle for cars. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ander289386/cars-germany?resource=download)

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
•	Basic data exploration and visualization
•	Look at data types, summary statistics, box plots and histograms to see data value distribution
•	Data is right skewed towards more expensive vehicles, meaning the majority of vehicles are at the lower price range. Inter Quartile Range is about 7.5k to 19.5k Euros in price.
2. Data Wrangling and Enriching
•	Add additional column for manufacturer country using external Excel spreadsheet.
•	Perform a left join to add country attribute for car makers.
•	Perform data wrangling for incomplete entries after join.
3. Elementary Analysis
   1. correlation with prices
      •	More data wrangling and modification
      •	Coefficient of correlation calculation done for numerical values, only noteworthy correlation with price would be horsepower

   2. depreciation over time





Another point of analysis is finding value retention or car depreciation year over year. The secondary market for automobiles
is one of the robust so knowing which vehicles best retain value and what factors might impact that would  be a critical
point of consideration for industry players.


I need to write a script which finds which car make most retains its value. How? I'm not sure. I'd have to write a script,
maybe set up some SQL database, write the data into that database, then find which ones are best retaining in value.

After that, I think I'm good to go. I'm ready to be a data scientist 8 months from now. Easily. But I want to make money for now
so it goes.
