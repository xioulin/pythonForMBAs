Skills Demonstrated

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
•	Basic data exploration and visualization
•	Look at data types, summary statistics, box plots and histograms to see data value distribution
•	Data is right skewed towards more expensive vehicles, meaning the majority of vehicles are at the lower price range. Inter Quartile Range is about 7.5k to 19.5k Euros in price.
2. Data Wrangling and Enriching
•	Add additional column for manufacturer country using external Excel spreadsheet.
•	Perform a left join to add country attribute for car makers.
•	Perform data wrangling for incomplete entries after join.
3. Elementary Analysis
   1. correlation with prices
