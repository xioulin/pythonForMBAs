<!--    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,-->
<!--that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,-->
<!--that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to-->
<!--secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving-->
<!--their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any-->
<!--Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right-->
<!--of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,-->
<!--laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in-->
<!--such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and-->
<!--    Happiness. <span>Prudence</span>, indeed, will dictate that Governments long-->
<!--established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and-->
<!--accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed-->
<!--to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by-->
<!--abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long-->
<!--train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object-->
<!--evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their-->
<!--right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new-->
<!--Guards for their future security.-->
